To make it easier for the neural network to process, we divide each value by 255 to get to a number between 0 and 1 for each pixel in each image. Performing a transformation like this to make the data easier to process in a machine learning method is called pre-processing.  Different pre-processing steps may be required for different types of data. \n",

This is a bit of an arbitrary decision, but based on our experience, this is large enough of a sample (more will just take longer to process but won't improve accuracy of the model) --- but don't take our word for it, you can play around with the training and testing sample on your own.

The rows are the correct value and the columns are the predicted value. The numbers on the axes represent the 26 letters in the alphabet (though EMNIST just represents letters as numbers, so 0=A, 1=B, etc.), so the brightness of cell (0,0) represents the number of times that our network correctly predicted that an \"A\" is an \"A.\"  The diagonal line of cells shows when the predicted value is correct.
